* [XML](https://github.com/amylmiller7/XML): Includes XML, XSL, and XSD files created to explore using XML technologies. Also includes Java file to render XML as HTML.

## Knowledge sharing

At Genesys, I gave a presentation to the larger documentation team about the embedded client integrations that I documented as a solo embedded technical writer on the integrations teams. 

I also provided two training presentations to the larger documentation team about the tools and processes (docs-as-code) for working on developer documentation.

* Working with content in the Developer Center (part two), February 20, 2019
* Working with content in the Developer Center (part one), January 14, 2019

## Continuous learning

The following subsections cover select courses that I took in-person and online, divided by subject.

### Generative AI
After the emergence of generative AI in late 2022 and the rise of generative AI tools at AWS, I started investigating and experimenting with using AI for internal and external documentation. 

By May 2025, to help standardize and share knowledge of generative AI use, tooling, and best practices at AWS, key members of the Technical Content Experience organization designed an intensive training course for technical writers across the organization. In May and June 2025, I immersed myself in this six-week Quantum Leap program. Topics ranged from foundational concepts (such as prompt engineering) to advanced techniques (such as validating code examples and using agentic AI) to specialized use cases that individual writers showcased. The training was invaluable, deepening my knowledge and use of generative AI and the evolving tooling landscape at AWS through peer learning and shared expertise.
