## Software documentation

As an embedded technical writer at a software company, I worked closely with two delivery teams that practiced agile (scrum and kanban) software development. I documented cloud-based integrations between the Genesys Cloud platform and third-party products. I explained integration features for end-users, configuration and setup for system administrators, and customization, APIs, and SDKs for developers.

### APIs/SDKs

I was responsible for a variety of developer documentation.

## Hardware documentation

Previously, I worked in content localization and technical editing at a semiconductor company.

### Application notes

I worked with SMEs to edit new and revision application notes aimed at hardware design engineers. I checked spelling, grammar, and terminology, followed the company style and format, and optimized content for search engines (SEO).

### Data sheets

I made initial editing passes of data sheets, which were aimed at design engineers for the companyâ€™s analog and mixed-signal devices.

### Website

I edited product, solutions, and corporate pages for a semiconductor company that ranged from heavily technical to technical marketing. I researched the technology being discussed and rewrote the content, as needed, to fit the medium, message, and end-user.

### Technical marketing documentation

I worked with SMEs to edit product and solutions guides and product briefs for technical and non-technical audiences for use at trade shows, on the website, and in customer meetings. I prepared meta descriptions and abstracts of these guides for the website.
